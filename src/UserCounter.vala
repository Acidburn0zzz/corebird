  So, this is the plan:
  we wil just save every single time the user encounters another user.
  We then save the first 200 or so results and load them on startup.
  If the user types a name and no result is found, we try to search
  for that name via Twitter's search API.

 XXX: Check if this works well with sqlite, if not move to a simple text file.
